<h1>Zombie Outbreak Simulation</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
The Zombie Outbreak Simulation is a Python program that models a fictional zombie outbreak. It simulates interactions between humans and zombies, including the potential for infection, recovery, and rescue. The simulation provides insights into how the outbreak evolves over time and visualizes the changes in population dynamics through plots.

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Simulation of Susceptibles, Regular Zombies, and Super Zombies: Models human characters, regular zombies, and super zombies with distinct behaviors and attributes.</p>
<p>Infection and Recovery Mechanics: Susceptible humans can become infected, recover, or get rescued. The simulation tracks these changes.</p>
<p>Rescue Mechanism: The simulation can end with a rescue if a random event triggers it.</p>
<p>Visualization: Tracks and plots the population of susceptibles, regular zombies, super zombies, and recovered individuals over time.</p>

<h2>Code Structure</h2>
<p>Classes.py: Contains the class definitions for Character, Susceptible, RegularZombie, SuperZombie, and Recovered.</p>
<p>simulation.py: Contains the simulation logic, including the setup, execution of the simulation loop, and plotting of results.</p>

<h2>Example Output</h2>
After running the simulation, you will see a plot showing the population dynamics of susceptibles, regular zombies, super zombies, and recovered individuals over time. The script also prints the simulation results to the console, indicating whether all humans were rescued or turned into zombies.
